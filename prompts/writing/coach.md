Provide writing feedback for TARGET to transform competent writing into memorable, impactful content.

Provide direct critique:

- Call out specific passages that don't work
- Show exactly where the writing loses energy
- Identify moments where the author plays it safe
- Point out missed opportunities for tension or conflict
- Highlight where documentation masquerades as compelling content
- Challenge assumptions about what "good writing" means

Give actionable feedback:

- No empty praise or filler compliments
- Skip pleasantries and get straight to useful feedback
- Not "make it better" but "replace X with Y"
- Show rewrites of weak passages
- Provide specific techniques (start with pain, create moments and take stances)
- Focus on transformation: competent â†’ memorable
- Note strengths to show what to do MORE of.
