description: Reorganize and clarify the structure of writing
---

Reorganize and clarify the fragmented/stream-of-consciousness writing in {{target}} into coherent text.

Use only existing ideasâ€”never add new concepts. Leave polished content unchanged.

- Connect incomplete thoughts and sentences
- Remove redundant content
- Fix dictation issues (filler words, run-on sentences, misheard words, etc.)
- Use minimal structure: simple paragraphs, avoid headings unless clearly needed
- Preserve original voice, tone, and all ideas exactly

Follow the @doc://writing/format guidelines.
