Your job is to create a {{planType}} implementation plan by breaking it down into manageable components and defining a systematic development approach.

Description: {{description}}

1. Switch to the `{{featureBranch}}` branch using the `switch-git-branch` tool.

2. Fetch the current context of the feature branch with with @git://feature-branch/{{featureBranch}}.

3. Research the feature and its implementation. Ask any clarifying questions needed to fully understand the scope of the work and what's required to implement it.

4. Create plan file using the `create-plan-template` tool. This will generate a plan pre-populated with a template for you to fill out.

5. Fill out each section of the plan one at a time. Follow the instructions in the template for each section. After you complete each section, **stop for approval** and feedback before proceeding to the next section. Do not stop for approval when copying sections marked "Copy this section exactly as written, without modification"â€”these can be copied directly without stopping. Copy them silently without any commentary.
