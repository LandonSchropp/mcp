# {{title}} Implementation Plan

Feature branch: `{{featureBranch}}`
Base branch: `{{baseBranch}}`
{{#if linearIssueId}}Linear Issue ID: `{{linearIssueId}}`{{/if}}

## Overview

<!-- Write a brief description of the feature. Be succinct. -->

## Context

<!-- Summarize existing work and recent changes on the branch. -->

## Requirements

<!--
Describe what the feature needs to do. Focus on WHAT needs to happen, not HOW it will be implemented. Be succinct.

Examples of what could be included:

- User/system flow (e.g., "user clicks button → modal opens → user submits → confirmation posted")
- Data to store or retrieve
- Constraints and rules
- Expected outcomes
-->

## Implementation

<!--
Describe how you'll implement the feature before diving into the detailed Plan steps.

Examples of what could be included:

- Flow diagrams showing the sequence of events
- Key design decisions and rationale (e.g., why approach X over Y)
- Component relationships and data models
- Database schema changes (tables, columns, indexes)
-->

## Plan

<!--
Break down the implementation into logical phases. Phases are partitions of work that do not require user input or review while running.

For simple features, a single phase will suffice. For each phase, break down the requirements into specific steps with enough detail for independent implementation.
-->

### Phase 1: [Title]

<!-- ... -->

### Phase 2: [Title]

<!-- ... -->

## Process

<!-- Copy this Process section exactly as written, without modification: -->

For each phase above (in order) do the following using TDD (red, green, refactor):

1. Write tests for the functionality you're about to implement and run them. They should fail initially (red).
2. Implement each task with appropriate error handling and validation to make tests pass (green).
3. Refactor the code for clarity and maintainability while keeping tests green.
4. If implementation becomes blocked, STOP and seek guidance from the user.
5. Once the phase is complete, STOP and wait for user feedback.
6. Once the user has finished giving feedback, append "(✅ Complete)" to the phase's header.
