## Overview

<!-- Write a brief description of the bug. Be succinct. -->

## Context

<!-- Summarize changes on this branch that may have introduced the bug. -->

## Reproduction Steps

<!--
Describe how to reproduce the bug. If reproduction steps are not yet known, describe what is known about when/how the bug occurs. Be succinct.

Examples of what could be included:

- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Environment/conditions where it occurs
- What is happening (actual behavior)
- What should be happening (expected behavior)
-->

## Plan

### Phase 1: Reproduce and Write Failing Test

Reproduce the bug and write a test that demonstrates the failing behavior.

Steps:

- Confirm reproduction of the bug
- Write test(s) that fail due to the bug
- Verify the test failure matches the expected bug behavior

<!-- Add any additional details or modify steps as needed for this specific bug -->

### Phase 2: Fix Bug and Verify Test Passes

Implement the minimal fix and verify the test now passes.

Steps:

- Investigate root cause
- Implement the fix
- Verify the test passes
- Confirm the bug is resolved

<!-- Add any additional details or modify steps as needed for this specific bug -->

## Process

<!-- Copy this Process section exactly as written, without modification: -->

For each phase above (in order) do the following:

1. Follow the steps outlined in the phase.
2. If you cannot complete a step after 5 attempts, STOP and seek guidance from the user.
3. Once the phase is complete, STOP and wait for user feedback.
4. Once the user has finished giving feedback, append "(✅ Complete)" to the phase's header.

Once the bug is fixed, document:

- What the root cause was
- Why the bug occurred
- How the fix addresses the underlying issue
- Any preventive measures to avoid similar bugs in the future
