- Use `.` for class methods and `#` for instance methods in describe blocks.

  ```ruby
  # Bad
  describe "the authenticate method for User"
  describe "if the user is an admin"

  # Good
  describe ".authenticate"
  describe "#admin?"
  ```

- Use contexts. Start context block descriptions with 'when', 'with', or 'without' to organize related tests.

  ```ruby
  # Bad
  it "has 200 status code if logged in" do
    expect(response).to respond_with(200)
  end

  it "has 401 status code if not logged in" do
    expect(response).to respond_with(401)
  end

  # Good
  context "when logged in" do
    it { is_expected.to respond_with(200) }
  end

  context "when logged out" do
    it { is_expected.to respond_with(401) }
  end
  ```

- Keep descriptions concise and use proper articles ('a', 'an', 'the') and copulas (is/are) in test descriptions. When the test block has an implicit subject, start with a copula.

  ```ruby
  # Bad
  it "has 422 status code if an unexpected params will be added"

  # Good
  context "when the parameters are not valid" do
    it { is_expected.to respond_with(422) }
  end

  # Good (implicit subject)
  it "is true" do
    expect(subject).to be(true)
  end
  ```

- Prefer one assertion per test. Multiple assertions are acceptable when test setup is expensive, such as in system tests.

  ```ruby
  # Good (isolated)
  it { is_expected.to respond_with_content_type(:json) }
  it { is_expected.to assign_to(:resource) }

  # Good (not isolated)
  it "creates a resource" do
    expect(response).to respond_with_content_type(:json)
    expect(response).to assign_to(:resource)
  end
  ```

- Test valid, edge, and invalid cases, not just the happy path.

  ```ruby
  # Bad
  it "shows the resource"

  # Good
  describe "#destroy" do
    context "when resource is found" do
      it "responds with a 200 status"
      it "shows the resource"
    end

    context "when the resource is not found" do
      it "responds with a 404 status"
    end

    context "when the resource is not owned" do
      it "responds with a 404 status"
    end
  end
  ```

- Always use the `expect` syntaxâ€”never use `should`.

  ```ruby
  # Bad
  response.should respond_with_content_type(:json)

  # Good
  expect(response).to respond_with_content_type(:json)
  ```

  Use `is_expected.to` for one-line expectations with implicit subject.

  ```ruby
  # Bad
  it { should respond_with(422) }

  # Good
  it { is_expected.to respond_with(422) }
  ```

- Use `subject` to clarify what's being tested. Use named subjects for clearer test intent.

  ```ruby
  # Bad
  it { expect(assigns("message")).to match(/it was born in Belville/) }

  # Good (implicit)
  subject { assigns("message") }

  it { is_expected.to match(/it was born in Billville/) }

  # Good (named)
  subject(:hero) { Hero.first }

  it "carries a sword" do
    expect(hero.equipment).to include("sword")
  end
  ```

- Use `let` for lazy-loaded variables. Use `let!` for immediate evaluation.

  ```ruby
  # Bad
  before { @resource = create(:device) }
  before { @type = Type.find(@resource.type_id) }

  # Good (lazy)
  let(:type) { Type.find(resource.type_id) }

  # Good (immediate)
  let!(:admin) { create(:admin) }
  ```

- Use mocks sparingly, typically only when simulating external APIs. Test real behavior when possible.

  ```ruby
  # Good - mocking external API
  before { allow(WeatherService).to receive(:current_temperature).and_return(72) }
  ```

- Create only the test data you need. When creating lists of undifferentiated records, 3 is usually the right number.

- Use factories instead of fixtures. Avoid complex data setup when possible.

  ```ruby
  # Bad
  let(:user) { User.create(attributes) }

  # Good
  let(:user) { FactoryBot.create(:user) }
  ```

- Use shared examples sparingly, only when test patterns are very repetitive.

- Test actual behavior with real database interactions for models and full request cycles for controllers.

- Avoid "should" in test descriptions. Use present tense, third person.

  ```ruby
  # Bad
  it "should not update the user's email" do
    user.email.should == original_email
  end

  # Good
  it "does not update the user's email" do
    expect(user.email).to eq(original_email)
  end
  ```
