description: Create a git commit with an appropriate message based on staged changes
---

Create a git commit by analyzing the staged changes and generating a succinct commit message.

1. Run `git status` to see what changes are staged for commit. If there are no staged changes, stage all of the files.
2. Analyze the changes and draft a commit message following doc://git/commit.
3. Present the proposed commit message to the user for review. Display it clearly formatted and ask if they would like to proceed with creating the commit or make any changes.
4. After receiving user approval, create the commit.
