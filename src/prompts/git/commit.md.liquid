description: Create a git commit with an appropriate message

Create a git commit by analyzing the staged changes and generating a succinct commit message.

1. Run `git status` to see what changes are staged for commit. If there are no staged changes, stage all of the files.
2. Analyze the changes and draft a commit message following doc://git/commit.
3. Present the proposed commit message to the user for review. Display it clearly formatted and ask
   if they would like to proceed with creating the commit or make any changes. Display the commit in
   the following format, without any extra detail or description of what the commit does.

   ```
   Proposed commit message:

   <title>

   <body>
   ```
4. After receiving user approval, create the commit.
