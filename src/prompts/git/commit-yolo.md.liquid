title: Create Commit (YOLO)
description: Create a git commit with an appropriate message
---

Create a git commit by analyzing the staged changes and generating a succinct commit message.

1. Run `git status` to see what changes are staged for commit. If there are no staged changes, stage all of the files.
2. Analyze the changes and draft a commit message following doc://git/commit.
3. Create the commit.
